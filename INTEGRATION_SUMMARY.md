# Gemini AI Integration Summary

## What Was Done

I've successfully integrated Google's Gemini AI into your DemetriA IQ chat page. Here's what changed:

### Files Created

1. **`/src/routes/api/gemini/+server.ts`**
   - Server-side API endpoint for Gemini
   - Handles POST requests with prompts
   - Securely uses API key from environment variables
   - Returns AI-generated responses

2. **`/src/lib/gemini.ts`**
   - Helper function `sendPromptToGemini()`
   - Handles API calls from client components
   - Error handling and response parsing

3. **`/src/lib/examples/GeminiExample.svelte`**
   - Example component showing how to use Gemini
   - Can be used as reference for other features

4. **`.env.example`**
   - Template for environment variables
   - Shows required API key format

5. **`GEMINI_SETUP.md`**
   - Detailed setup instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Security best practices

6. **`setup-gemini.sh`**
   - Automated setup script
   - Installs dependencies
   - Creates .env file
   - Updates .gitignore

### Files Modified

1. **`/src/routes/iq/+page.svelte`**
   - ✅ Replaced mock responses with real Gemini AI
   - ✅ Added system prompt for agricultural expertise
   - ✅ Implemented conversation context (last 3 exchanges)
   - ✅ Added error handling and display
   - ✅ Added suggested questions UI
   - ✅ Improved loading states

## Architecture

```
User Question (IQ Page)
    ↓
sendPromptToGemini() [Client]
    ↓
POST /api/gemini [Server]
    ↓
Google Gemini API
    ↓
Response → User
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Agricultural Assistant**
- Specialized system prompt for farming advice
- Context-aware conversations
- Practical, actionable responses

### 2. **User Experience**
- Suggested questions for new users
- Real-time loading indicators
- Error notifications with dismiss option
- Smooth scrolling to new messages

### 3. **Security**
- API key stored server-side only
- Environment variable configuration
- No client-side exposure of credentials

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Graceful failure messages
- Console logging for debugging
- User-friendly error display

## How to Use

### Quick Start (Automated)

```bash
./setup-gemini.sh
```

### Manual Setup

1. Install package:
   ```bash
   npm install @google/generative-ai
   ```

2. Create `.env`:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. Get API key from:
   https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

4. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Visit: http://localhost:5173/iq

## Example Usage in Code

```typescript
import { sendPromptToGemini } from '$lib/gemini';

// Simple usage
const response = await sendPromptToGemini('How do I grow tomatoes?');

// With error handling
try {
  const response = await sendPromptToGemini(userQuestion);
  console.log(response);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('AI Error:', error);
}
```

## System Prompt

The AI is configured with this context:

> You are DemetriA IQ, an expert agricultural AI assistant. You provide practical, science-based advice on:
> - Crop cultivation and management
> - Soil health and fertilization
> - Pest and disease control
> - Irrigation and water management
> - Sustainable farming practices
> - Agricultural technology
>
> Provide clear, actionable advice. Keep responses concise (2-4 paragraphs) unless asked for more detail.

## Conversation Context

The system maintains context by:
- Sending last 6 messages (3 exchanges) to Gemini
- Including system prompt with each request
- Preserving conversation flow

## Testing

Try these questions on the IQ page:

1. "How do I improve soil quality?"
2. "What's the best time to plant wheat?"
3. "How can I control pests naturally?"
4. "What irrigation method should I use?"
5. "How often should I fertilize my crops?"

## Lint Errors (Expected)

You'll see these errors until you install the package:
- ❌ Cannot find module '@google/generative-ai'
- ❌ Cannot find module '$lib/gemini'
- ❌ Module has no exported member 'GEMINI_API_KEY'

These will resolve after running:
```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Conversation History**
   - Save chats to database
   - Load previous conversations

2. **Streaming Responses**
   - Show text as it's generated
   - Better UX for long responses

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent API abuse
   - Track usage per user

4. **Multi-modal Support**
   - Image analysis (Gemini Pro Vision)
   - Crop disease detection from photos

5. **Field-Specific Context**
   - Pass field data to AI
   - Personalized recommendations

## Cost Considerations

- **Free Tier**: 60 requests/minute
- **Paid Tier**: Check [Google AI Pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing)
- Each conversation uses 1 API call per message

## Support

For issues:
1. Check `GEMINI_SETUP.md` for troubleshooting
2. Verify `.env` configuration
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure API key is valid
